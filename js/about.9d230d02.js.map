It was the first project that I designed and built end to end on my own, so although the goal was to make it functional and complete, I had to pivot many times based on my knowledge and skills up to that point as well as the associated time constraints. Once I graduated, I decided to rework it. I still wanted to maintain the low scroll layout but had to revisit how everything would work with more content. These redesigns reflect as much of the original functionality as I could think of, and include a lot of minor image and content placement changes that were difficult to code initially.\n              </p>\n              <br /><br />\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"col-lg\">\n              <!-- <p class=\"h1 font-weight-bold\">Does</p><br> -->\n              <!-- <h2 class=\"h3 font-weight-bold\">Student<br>2019 - Present</h2><br> -->\n              <p>\n                Designing with the understanding that I would have more time to code the second version also gave me a lot of confidence to not shy away from more complex designs. I was also able to spend more time on the user experience looking at what would work best for the them, and what options were available to help with ease of use. I added filter options for the gallery, an accordian style design for the FAQ question and answer page, and navigation options as needed. I also reworked the forms, and added a settings drop down on the profile page.\n              </p>\n              \n            </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <div class=\"row justify-content-center\">\n              <div class=\"col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6\">\n              <p>\n                <img src=\"../assets/5FAQ1.png\" style=\"width: 100%;\"/>\n              </p>\n              </div>\n            \n               <div class=\"col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6\">\n              <p>\n                <img src=\"../assets/18Profile1.png\" style=\"width: 100%;\"/>\n              </p>\n              </div>\n               <div class=\"col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6\">\n              <p>\n                <img src=\"../assets/8Gallery.png\" style=\"width: 100%;\"/>\n              </p>\n              </div>\n               <div class=\"col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6\">\n              <p>\n                <img src=\"../assets/10Create.png\" style=\"width: 100%;\"/>\n              </p><br /><br />\n              </div>\n              \n                    \n            <div class=\"col-12\">\n             \n              <p class=\"h1 font-weight-bold\">Revised Screens</p>\n              <br />\n            \n          </div>\n          \n             <Slider />\n         \n          </div>\n\n\n        </div>\n\n        \n      </div>\n</section>\n       <section id=\"sectionFive\" class=\"greybgOne\">\n      <div class=\"wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"container\">\n          \n\n          <div class=\"row justify-content-center\">\n            <div class=\"col-12\">\n              <p class=\"display-4 font-weight-bold special\">\n                <strong>Third Iteration</strong>\n              </p><br />\n              <p class=\"h1 font-weight-bold\">Mobile First Design</p>\n              <br />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <div class=\"row justify-content-center\">\n            <div class=\"col-lg\">\n              <!-- <h2 class=\"h3 font-weight-bold\">Student<br>2019 - Present</h2><br> -->\n              <p>\n                For my third iteration of this project, my aim was to design a mobile first pixel perfect version.

After understanding the ins and outs of designing for smart\n                watches, our class continued our rapid prototyping exercise, but\n                were asked to design a smart watch app. I chose Beer Buddy to\n                see how I could design it for a much smaller screen, with much\n                shorter interaction times per screen.\n              </p>\n              <br /><br

parameters. Reviews after this\n                iteration centered around touch areas, sizing of all assets, and\n                information presentation.\n              </p>\n              <br /><br />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"row\">\n            <div class=\"col-12\">\n              <p>\n                <img\n                  src=\"../assets/sketch1.png\"\n                  style=\"width: 100%;\"\n                />\n              </p>\n              <br /><br />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"row\">\n            <div class=\"col-lg\">\n              <p>\n                During the second round of sketching, I cleaned up some screens,\n                and tried to realistically layout content that would need to be\n                displayed. I realized quickly that I would need to add a\n                solution for moving through multiple screens of information as\n                it would be impossible to fit all the content in a
